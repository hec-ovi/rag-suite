Introduction

Software engineering has rapidly emerged as a frontier application area for large language models (LLMs).
As models have grown more capable, they have progressed from simple program synthesis (Austin et al.,
2021), to automatic code completion (Chen et al., 2021), to general-purpose code generation (Li et al., 2022;
Lai et al., 2023), to understanding code execution (Gu et al., 2024), and competition-le

### Agentic Chunk 2
- chars: 576
- rationale: Highlights recent achievements and distinguishes between agentic and agentless approaches, providing a deeper exploration of practical implementations.
```text
Most recently, LLMs have demonstrated strong software engineering ability to tackle real-world issue resolution in open-source repositories (Jimenez et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024; Xia et al., 2025; Zeng et al., 2025). To support such capabilities, more sophi

### Agentic Chunk 3
- chars: 165
- rationale: Preserves the incomplete concluding statement that signals the forthcoming focus on agent scaffold importance, maintaining fidelity to the source text.
```text
While model capabilities continue to improve, success in real-world software engineering depends not only on the underlying LLM, but also on the agent scaffold : the
